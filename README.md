# Using Machine Learning Models to Make Predictions From Raw Data
Process NASA data from the Kepler space telescope to create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the datasets. Data is preprocessed, scaled and tuned for modeling, and then modeled using multiple iterations. 

Data is scaled using MinMaxScaler, and tuned using GridSearch.
